        "body": "(Extract taken from the first page)<br><br>MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his<br>burial was signed by the clergyman, the cler, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge<br>signed it: and Scrooge‟s name was good upon ‟Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.<br>Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.<br>Mind! I don‟t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly<br>dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest<br>piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my<br>unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country‟s done for. You will therefore permit me to<br>repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.<br>Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he<br>were partners for I don‟t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole<br>administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And<br>even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of<br>business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.<br>The mention of Marley‟s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no<br>doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come<br>of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet‟s Father died<br>before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in<br>an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged<br>gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul‟s Churchyard for<br>instance—literally to astonish his son‟s weak mind.<br>Scrooge never painted out Old Marley‟s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the<br>warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes<br>people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to<br>both names. It was all the same to him.<br>Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching,<br>grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel<br>had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold<br>within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait;<br>made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime<br>was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature<br>always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn‟t thaw it one degree at<br>Christmas.<br>External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry<br>weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon<br>its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn‟t know where to have him.<br>The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only<br>one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.<br>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how<br>are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no<br>children asked him what it was o‟clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the<br>way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men‟s dogs appeared to know him; and<br>when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then<br>would wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”"
